# Perfectris

An open-source implementation of the Tetris Guideline, with controls based on *Tetris Effect*, as it tends to control very well, then fine-tuned to be as nice as possible.

This game was also built to be the most customisable Tetris clone possible - everything can be tweaked and tuned to exactly how you like it.
